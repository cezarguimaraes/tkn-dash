`tkn-dash` is a barebones, lightweight and **fast** alternative to [Tekton Dashboard](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard).

Some of its highlights are:
- no deployment required: can be used as a command line tool.
- syntax highlighting of step's `script` fields, powered by [alecthomas/chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma#supported-languages)
- can be used without cluster access by parsing JSON exports of `Tekton` resources.
- _blazingly fastâ„¢_
- powered by [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).

## Installing

- Via `go install`:
```bash
go install github.com/cezarguimaraes/tkn-dash@latest
```
- Self-contained executables for Linux, Windows and Mac are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/cezarguimaraes/tkn-dash/releases).

## Usage

- Start the server on a random port, using local kubernetes credentials and open a browser to it:
  ```bash
  tkn-dash -browser
  ```
- On a specific port:
  ```bash
  tkn-dash -browser -addr :8000
  ```
- Using `Tekton` resources snapshots - does not require cluster credentials:

  ```bash
  tkn-dash -browser tmp/*.json
  ```
  > For this scenario, snapshots could have been created as follows:
    ```bash
    mkdir tmp
    kubectl get taskruns -o json > tmp/trs.json
    kubectl get pipelineruns -o json > tmp/prs.json
    ```
